Because ACE2 has been reported to facilitate cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2, the authors suggest that ICS may modulate the clinical course of COVID-19.","Through the analysis of ACE2 levels, the authors concluded that COVID-19 may adversely affect colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) patient survival outcomes. Therefore, additional preventive measures may be needed to protect patients from COVID-19.","Authors' findings support recent reports that a D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein improves its ability to transduce host cells. Specifically, the G614 variant was more resistant to cleavage than the D614 variant, which may improve the ability of newly-assembled virions to include more receptor binding-capable S protein.","Using a lentiviral system, authors reported three key findings: 1) SARS-CoV-2-Spike (S) protein-mediated cell entry strongly depends on TMPRSS2 coexpression, 2) the SARS-CoV-2 D614G mutant exhibited activity for entry approximately 3.5x that of the wild type, and 3) despite the biological and structural changes, the antigenicity of the D614G mutant did not vary significantly from the wild type.",null,null,"The authors designed a thermostable Spike (S) protein trimer, which they envision would be useful for research in vaccinology, diagnostics, and other scientific research involving SARS-CoV-2.","Using a quantitative deep mutational scanning approach, the authors determined the influence of mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the protein's binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor. The authors identified mutations that increased binding affinity between the RBD, as well as patterns relating to the trade-off between protein stability and binding affinity.","In this preprint, the authors screened through 3,000 drugs in monkey (Vero), human hepatocyte (Huh7.5), and human lung epithelial (Calu-3) cells. They identified 9 antiviral candidates active against SARS-CoV-2 in the Calu-3 cells.","Using a Golden Syrian hamster in vivo model, the authors found that a single-dose of rVSV-âˆ†Gspike vaccine was safe and efficacious in protecting against a SARS-CoV-2 challenge.","The authors sequenced SARS-CoV-2 isolates from symptomatic COVID-19 cases in a suburban and rural community in the southeastern US. Their results suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein D614G mutant (associated with greater pathogenecity) is the dominant strain in the US.","This preprint is a preliminary report from the RECOVERY trial: dexamethasone reduced deaths in patients receiving mechanical ventilation as well as in patients receiving medical oxygen without mechanical ventilation, but did not reduce mortality in patients not receiving respiratory support at randomisation.","Using in situ cryo-electron tomography, the authors visualised double-stranded RNA within double-membrane vesicles. They found that membrane formation is influenced by the spike trimer and viral ribonucleoprotein complex recruitment into virion budding sites. These findings may have important implications for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral discovery.","Using a mouse model of ischemia-reperfusion lung injury, the authors showed that Fostamatnib induces the down-regulation and internalization of MUC1, and reduces the expression of MUC1 in the lung.","The authors describe an inexpensive, manually-powered diagnostic to detect COVID-19 RNA from saliva. This hardware is compatible with the LAMP assay described by Rabe and Cepko (2020).",null,null,"By investigating the histology of various tissues isolated from post-mortems of fatal COVID-19 cases, the authors concluded that death from COVID-19 may mainly be attributed to the immune response rather than tissue-specific injury.","The authors found a decline in antibody titres a few months after patients were exposed to COVID-19. These findings may have important implications in preventing reinfection by SARS-CoV-2, as well as in vaccine development. On the other hand, they may also be natural--following challenge, antibody titres naturally decrease over time.","The authors established the mechanistic association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical manifestation of COVID-19. The presence of antibodies targeting the viral spike protein from patient blood triggers a cytokine storm in activated human macrophages, which compromises the vascular endothelial barrier and promotes blood coagulation.",null,null,null,null,"In this study, the authors investigated the effectiveness of convalescent plasma in treating COVID-19 in
