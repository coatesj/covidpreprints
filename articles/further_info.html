The authors found that hydroxychloroquine with antibiotics led to better viral clearance, reduced hospital stay, and enhanced cough symptom resolution, but caution that toxicity was not measured in their study.","Infection fatality rates from seroprevalence studies are lower than original estimates made in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Caveats: Concerns regarding the paper's methodology have been raised by other researchers, such as https://twitter.com/GidMK/status/1262956011872280577","SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in primary sewage sludge highly correlated with COVID-19 epidemiological curve and local hospital admissions, with a seven- to three- day leading indication, respectively.","https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html","https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html","https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html","https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html","The authors identified a consensus peripheral blood immunological signature across a heterogeneous population.

The focus on early and near complete identification of cases interrupted transmission; while a complete lockdown was avoided with the implementation of more general physical distancing community measures.","The authors showed that inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) administration attenuated pulmonary expression of ACE2 in various human and animal models. Because ACE2 has been reported to facilitate cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2, the authors suggest that ICS may modulate the clinical course of COVID-19.","Through the analysis of ACE2 levels, the authors concluded that COVID-19 may adversely affect colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) patient survival outcomes. Therefore, additional preventive measures may be needed to protect patients from COVID-19.","Authors reported that a D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may increase its infectivity.","Authors' findings support recent reports that a D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein improves its ability to transduce host cells. Specifically, the G614 variant was more resistant to cleavage than the D614 variant, which may improve the ability of newly-assembled virions to include more receptor binding-capable Spike protein.","Using a lentiviral system, authors reported three key findings: 1) SARS-CoV-2-S-mediated cell entry strongly depends on TMPRSS2 coexpression, 2) the SARS-CoV-2 D614G mutant exhibited activity for entry approximately 3.5x that of the wild type, and 3) despite the biological and structural changes, the antigenicity of the D614G mutant did not vary significantly from the wild type.","https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html","https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html","The authors designed a thermostable Spike (S) protein trimer, which they envision would be useful for research in vaccinology, diagnostics, and other scientific research involving SARS-CoV-2.","In this preprint, the authors screened through 3,000 drugs in monkey (Vero), human hepatocyte (Huh7.5), and human lung epithelial (Calu-3) cells. They identified 9 antiviral candidates active against SARS-CoV-2 in the Calu-3 cells.","Using a Golden Syrian hamster in vivo model, the authors found that a single-dose of rVSV-âˆ†Gspike vaccine was safe and efficacious in protecting against a SARS-CoV-2 challenge.","The authors sequenced SARS-CoV-2 isolates from symptomatic COVID-19 cases in a suburban and rural community in the southeastern US. Their results suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein D614G mutant (associated with greater pathogenecity) is the dominant strain in the US.","Using a quantitative deep mutational scanning approach, the authors determined the influence of mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the protein's binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor. The authors identified mutations that increased binding affinity between the RBD, as well as patterns relating to the trade-off between protein stability and binding affinity.","This preprint is a preliminary report from the RECOVERY trial: dexamethasone reduced deaths in patients receiving mechanical ventilation as well as in patients receiving medical oxygen without mechanical ventilation, but did not reduce mortality in patients not receiving respiratory support at randomisation.","Using in situ cryo-electron tomography, the authors visualised double-stranded RNA within double-membrane vesicles. They found that membrane formation is influenced by the spike trimer and viral ribonucleoprotein complex recruitment into virion budding sites. These findings may have important implications for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral discovery.","https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html","https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html"],["","","","","","","","","","Sinai review here:\nhttp://disq.us/p/28aczcq","","","","","","","","","","Review by Mount Sinai Immunolgoy Review project (disq.us/t/3luocex)","Review by Mount Sinai Immunolgoy Review project (http://disq.us/p/289seyf)","Evaluated the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against the risk of importation of 2019-nCoV based on travel volumes from infected provinces in China to African countries.

It appeared in the journal International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents a day after it was submitted. 42 COVID-19 positive patients were enrolled in this study, 16 of which recieved normal care (control) and 26 receiving the Hydroxychloroquine therapy. Out of these 26, 20 completed the study with 6 of these patients also recieving Azithromycin (antibiotic). At day 6 of treatment, 100% of patients recieving the combination therapy were COVID-19 negative with approximately 50% of the Hydroxychloroquine-only group being COVID-19 negative. In contrast, most of the control were COVID-19 positive. Importantly, this was not a randomised clinical trial and there were numerous issues with the study and the subsequent \"peer review\" prior to publication. These are outlined fully by Dr Elizabeth Bik (https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2020/03/24/thoughts-on-the-gautret-et-al-paper-about-hydroxychloroquine-and-azithromycin-treatment-of-covid-19-infections/). Also see Mount Sinai review of the preprint: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20037135v1#comment-4842302900. Subsequent work from other groups also suggests that Hydroxychloroquine is not an effective treatment (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X20300858)","There has been some anecdotal evidence of SARS-CoV-2 virus being detected in patients that had recovered from COVID-19. To investigate the possibility of reinfection, this study infected four rhesus macaques with SARS-CoV-2 and studied reinfection. One of the monkeys was sacrificied at 7 days post infection (dpi) to confirm viral distribution throughout organs. Following alleviation of COVID-19 symptoms and clearance of SARS-CoV-2, two of the rhesus macaques were rechallenged with the virus at 18 dpi. Comparing to one control monkey up until 14 days post-rechallenge (dpr), it was evident that the virus was unable to reinfect the monkeys, one of which was sacrificed at 5 dpr to analyse viral distribution throughout the body. Despite very low numbers of monkeys being used in this study, it provides initial evidence that antibody production in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection provides protection against subsequent exposures. This study needs to be followed up with a greatly increased cohort size to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 reinfection is not possible.

A recent study (https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/04/02/2004168117) from China showed that plasma transfusion to 10 severe adult cases (receiving additional antiviral and antibiotic, antifungal or corticosteroids treatment) led to improved symptoms within 1 to 3 days and increase in neutralising antibody titers and disappearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. FDA approved the use of convalescent plasma to treat severely ill and a clinical trial to evaluate it is underway in US.In this preprint authors evaluate levels of neutralising antibodies (NAbs) from recovered patients with clinical manifestations. Plasma from 5 patients recovered from COVID-19 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 PsV infection in in vitro in cell line. SARS-CoV-2 NAbs were not reactive with SARS-CoV. Potential caveats: only performed on plasma from patients with mild symptoms. Might be very important to test plasma of advanced cases to see if there is correlation. Authors acknowledge these limitations and exclusion of these patients due to severe and critical cases receiving passive antibody treatment before sample collection.

One concern relates to the control group of which 30% still recieved Azithromyin. This confuses the interpretation of the data. Moreover, the control group consisted of more patients who recieved ventillation. Despite this, at worse the data suggests that HCQ is no more beneficial than no treatment for COVID-19. As this is a retrospective study and not truely randomly controlled, caution should be exercised when interpreting these results.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Reviewed: https://observablehq.com/@ismms-himc/covid-19-sars-cov-2-preprints-from-medrxiv-and-biorxiv\n\nhttp://disq.us/p/29crc30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>Date<\/th>\n      <th>Title<\/th>\n      <th>further information<\/th>\n      <th>preprint summary<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"lengthMenu":[10,25,30,50,75,100],"pageLength":50,"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0}]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
