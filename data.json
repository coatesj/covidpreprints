    "longerSummary": "There has been some anecdotal evidence of SARS-CoV-2 virus being detected in patients that had recovered from COVID-19. To investigate the possibility of reinfection, this study infected four rhesus macaques with SARS-CoV-2 and studied reinfection. One of the monkeys was sacrificied at 7 days post infection (dpi) to confirm viral distribution throughout organs. Following alleviation of COVID-19 symptoms and clearance of SARS-CoV-2, two of the rhesus macaques were rechallenged with the virus at 18 dpi. Comparing to one control monkey up until 14 days post-rechallenge (dpr), it was evident that the virus was unable to reinfect the monkeys, one of which was sacrificed at 5 dpr to analyse viral distribution throughout the body. Despite very low numbers of monkeys being used in this study, it provides initial evidence that antibody production in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection provides protection against subsequent exposures. This study needs to be followed up with a greatly increased cohort size to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 reinfection is not possible. (Mount Sinai Immunology review here: http://disq.us/p/288knpd)",

Additional data from the lab behind this paper continues to be suspicious (https://twitter.com/houndcl/status/1248294470837133312)",
    "longerSummary": "This preprint was the first to describe the use of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin to treat COVID-19. It appeared in the journal International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents a day after it was submitted. 42 COVID-19 positive patients were enrolled in this study, 16 of which recieved normal care (control) and 26 receiving the Hydroxychloroquine therapy. Out of these 26, 20 completed the study with 6 of these patients also recieving Azithromycin (antibiotic). At day 6 of treatment, 100% of patients recieving the combination therapy were COVID-19 negative with approximately 50% of the Hydroxychloroquine-only group being COVID-19 negative. In contrast, most of the control were COVID-19 positive. Importantly, this was not a randomised clinical trial and there were numerous issues with the study and the subsequent \"peer review\" prior to publication. These are outlined fully by Dr Elizabeth Bik (https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2020/03/24/thoughts-on-the-gautret-et-al-paper-about-hydroxychloroquine-and-azithromycin-treatment-of-covid-19-infections/). Also see Mount Sinai review of the preprint: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20037135v1#comment-4842302900. Subsequent work from other groups also suggests that Hydroxychloroquine is not an effective treatment (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X20300858)",

    "briefSummary": "ACE2 has become an important research topic in relation to COVID-19 pathogenesis.  This study mined around 7000 exosome from Italian genomes looking for variants of the ACE2 receptor, which has been proposed as the main host receptor for SARS-COV-2. Among three common missense changes, unreported in Easter Asia population, p.Asn720Asp is predicted to affect cleavage-dependent virion intake. Additional 30 missense variants were identified, some of which are predicted to affect the interaction with the spike protein.\nCaveats to this paper: the variants discovered that could change the way the virus interacts with the ACE2 receptor are rare. As these variants are so rare, they may notexplain the heterogeneity in disease outcomes in the general public. No correlations with patient data , all predictions from computational studies. Consequently, the hypothesis that these variants might explain higher mortality rates in Italy compared to China is probably over-stretched. [Additional credit: Giulia Paci, @giulia_paci, UCL LMCB]",

FDA approved the use of convalescent plasma to treat severely ill and a clinical trial to evaluate it is underway in US.In this preprint authors evaluate levels of neutralising antibodies (NAbs) from recovered patients with clinical manifestations. Plasma from 5 patients recovered from COVID-19 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 PsV infection in in vitro in cell line. SARS-CoV-2 NAbs were not reactive with SARS-CoV. Potential caveats: only performed on plasma from patients with mild symptoms. Might be very important to test plasma of advanced cases to see if there is correlation. Authors acknowledge these limitations and exclusion of these patients due to severe and critical cases receiving passive antibody treatment before sample collection.

One concern relates to the control group of which 30% still recieved Azithromyin. This confuses the interpretation of the data.
