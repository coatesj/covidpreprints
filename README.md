Coding & website maintained by Dr J Coates (jc2216@cam.ac.uk) and the preLights COVID team (prelights.biologists.com). Thanks to Lars Hubatsch for contributions to the coding. 


Suggestions for improvement to the code are welcomed - The current code is the result of a "learn as I do it" approach. 

This is one of the Sprint 2020 projects!
