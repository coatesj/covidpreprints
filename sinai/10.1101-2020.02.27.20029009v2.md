*Keywords:* Clinical Characteristics, Non Survivors, retrospective study

*Main Findings:* This is a simple study reporting clinical
characteristics of patients who did not survive COVID-19. All patients
(mean age=69.22 years) had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
and their median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days. The median time
from onset to death was 17 days. Most patients were older male (70%
male) with co-morbidities and only 11 % were smokers. 75% patients
showed bilateral pneumonia. Many patients had chronic diseases,
including hypertension (58.33%). cardiovascular disease (22.22%) and
diabetes (19.44%). Typical clinical feature measured in these patients
includes lymphopenia and elevated markers of inflammation.

*Limitations: As noted by the authors, the conclusions of this study are
very limited because this is single-centered study focusing on a small
cohort of patients who did not survive. Many clinical parameters
observed by the authors (such* as increase levels of serum CRP, PCT,
IL-6) have also been described in other COVID19 patients who survived
the infection

*Relevance:* This study is essentially descriptive and may be useful for
clinical teams monitoring COVID19 patients.
