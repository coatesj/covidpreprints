#### Main Findings

While RT-PCR is being used currently to routinely diagnose infection
with SARS-CoV-2, there are significant limitations to the use of a
nucleic acid test that lead to a high false-negative rate. This
article describes ELISAs that can measure IgM and IgG antibodies
against the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 to test samples from 238
patients (153 positive by RT-PCR and 85 negative by RT-PCR) at
different times after symptom onset. The positivity rate of the IgM
and/or IgG ELISAs was greater than that of the RT-PCR (81.5%
compared to 64.3%) with similar positive rates in the confirmed and
suspected cases (83% and 78.8%, respectively), suggesting that many
of the suspected but RT-PCR-negative cases were also infected. The
authors also found that the ELISAs have higher positive rates later
after symptom onset while RT-PCR is more effective as a diagnostic
test early during the infection.

#### Limitations

I cannot identify any limitations to this study.

#### Significance

The authors make a strong case for using a combination of ELISA and
RT-PCR for diagnosis of infection with SARS-CoV-2, especially
considering the dynamics of positivity rates of RT-PCR and ELISA.
Fewer false-negative diagnoses would improve infection control and
patient management.
