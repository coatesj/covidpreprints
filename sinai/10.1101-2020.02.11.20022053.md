#### Major Findings

These authors looked at 17 hospitalized patients with COVID-19
confirmed by RT-PCR in Dazhou, Sichuan. Patients were admitted between
January 22 and February 10 and the final data were collected on February
11. Of the 17 patients, 12 remained hospitalized while 5 were discharged
after meeting national standards. The authors observed no differences
based on the sex of the patients but found that the discharged patients
were younger in age (p = 0.026) and had higher lymphocyte counts (p =
0.005) and monocyte counts (p = 0.019) upon admission.

#### Limitations

This study is limited in the sample size of the study and the last
data collection point was only one day after some of the patients were
admitted.

#### Significance

These findings have been somewhat supported by subsequent studies
that show that older age and an immunocompromised state are more likely
to result in a more severe clinical course with COVID-19. However, other
studies have been published that report on larger numbers of cases.
