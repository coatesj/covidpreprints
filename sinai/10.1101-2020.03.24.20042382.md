#### Keywords

- CoVID-19
- 2019-nCoV
- SARS-CoV-2
- IgG
- IgM
- clinical
- kinetics
- antibodies

#### Main Findings

-   Prospective cohort of 67 patients, clinical specimens taken and
    follow-up conducted.

-   Viral shedding, serum IgM, IgG antibody against NP evaluated and
    correlated to disease severity and clinical outcome

-   Viral RNA levels peaked at 1 week from febrile/cough symptom onset
    in sputum, nasal swabs, and stool samples. Shedding ranged from
    12-19 days (median ranges) and was longer in severe patients.

-   IgM and IgG titers stratified patients into three archetypes as
    ‘strong vs weak vs non-responders’. Strong responders (with higher
    IgM/IgG titers) were significantly higher in severe patients.

#### Limitations

Specific for immune monitoring.

-   Not clear if stool RNA captured from live infection in
    intestine/liver or from swallowed sputum. Transmission electron
    microscopy (TEM) carried out on sputum samples as proof of concept,
    but not stools. TEM unreasonable for actual clinical diagnosis.

-   Several patients had co-morbidities (such as pulmonary and liver
    disease) that were not accounted for when tracking antibody
    responses. Viral kinetics and IgM/IgG titers in subsets of patients
    with underlying conditions/undergoing certain medication would be
    informative.

#### Significance

-   Three archetypes of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 with different
    disease progression and kinetics is useful to stratify patients, and
    for future serological tests.

-   Strong spike-IgG levels often correlate with lymphopenia and
    CoVID-19 disease severity [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.20.20039495], similar to macaque
    studies in SARS [@doi:10.1172/jci.insight.123158]. It would be critical to see if anti-NP or
    anti-Spike IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 also elicit similar
    detrimental effects before clinical use.
