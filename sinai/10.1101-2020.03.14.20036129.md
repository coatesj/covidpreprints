A.  Highly accurate and sensitive diagnostic detection of SARS-CoV-2 by
    digital PCR

B.  Diagnosis, digital PCR

C.  The authors present a digital PCR (dPCR) diagnostic test for
    SARS-CoV-2 infection. In 103 individuals that were confirmed in a
    follow-up to be infected, the standard qPCR test had a positivity
    rate of 28.2% while the dPCR test detected 87.4% of the infections
    by detecting an additional 61 positive cases. The authors also
    tested samples from close contacts (early in infection stage) and
    convalescing individuals (late in infection stage) and were able to
    detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in many more samples using dPCR
    compared to qPCR.

D.  I did not detect limitations.

E.  The authors make a strong case for the need for a highly sensitive
    and accurate confirmatory method for diagnosing COVID-19 during this
    outbreak and present a potential addition to the diagnostic arsenal.
    They propose a dPCR test that they present has a dramatically lower
    false negative rate than the standard RT-qPCR tests and can be
    especially beneficial in people with low viral load, whether they
    are in the earlier or later stages of infection.
