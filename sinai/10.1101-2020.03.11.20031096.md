#### Keywords

- ABO blood group
- COVID-19 susceptibility

#### Main Findings

These authors compared the ABO blood group of 2,173 patients with
RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 from hospitals in Wuhan and Shenzhen with the
ABO blood group distribution in unaffected people in the same cities
from previous studies (2015 and 2010 for Wuhan and Shenzhen,
respectively). They found that people with blood group A are
statistically over-represented in the number of those infected and who
succumb to death while those with blood group O are statistically
underrepresented with no influence of age or sex.

#### Limitations

This study compares patients with COVID-19 to the general population
but relies on data published 5 and 10 years ago for the control. The
mechanisms that the authors propose may underlie the differences they
observed require further study.

#### Significance

Risk stratification based on blood group may be beneficial for
patients and also healthcare workers in infection control. Additionally,
investigating the mechanism behind these findings could lead to better
developing prophylactic and therapeutic targets for COVID-19.
