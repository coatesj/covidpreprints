#### Main Findings

Using a transgenic human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(hACE2) mouse that has previously been shown susceptible to infection by
SARS-CoV, Bao et al. create a model of pandemic 2019-nCoV strain
coronavirus. The model includes interstitial hyperplasia in lung tissue,
moderate inflammation in bronchioles and blood vessels, and histology
consistent with viral pneumonia at 3 days post infection. Wildtype did
not experience these symptoms. In addition, viral antigen and hACE2
receptor were found to co-localize the lung by immunofluorescence 3-10
days post infection only in the hACE2 infected mice.

#### Limitations

The characterization of the infection remains incomplete,
as well as lacking characterization of the immune response other than
the presence of a single antiviral antibody. Though they claim to
fulfill Koch’s postulates, they only isolate the virus and re-infect
Vero cells, rather than naive mice.

#### Significance

This paper establishes a murine model for 2019-nCoV
infection with symptoms consistent with viral pneumonia. Though not
fully characterized, this model allows in vivo analysis of viral entry
and pathology that is important for the development of vaccines and
antiviral therapeutics.
