#### Keywords

- CoVID-19
- 2019-nCoV
- SARS-CoV-2
- anosmia
- olfaction
- scRNAseq


#### Main Findings

-   Study analyzed bulk and scRNAseq data of olfactory cell types from
    publicly-available mouse, nonhuman primate and human datasets.

-   show that *ACE2* and *TMPRSS2* (genes involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry)
    are expressed in olfactory epithelial (OE) cells, basal stem cells
    and respiratory epithelium (RE), but not sensory neurons.

-   Comparison of human RE and OE datasets (Deprez et al. 2019; Durante
    et al. 2020) revealed that *ACE2* and *TMPRSS2* expression in OE
    sustentacular cells was similar to expression in the remainder of
    the non-nasal respiratory tract.

#### Limitations

-   Transcript data alone from healthy respiratory/olfactory cells is
    not sufficient to confirm infectivity of nasal passage, or to
    indicate damage to epithelia.

-   No mechanism defined for anosmia; it is not clear if epithelial
    injury leads to reduced sensitivity or increased inflammation and
    altered immune contexture drives neural/epithelial dysfunction. Will
    be critical to test this in CoVID-19 patient samples or mouse
    models.

#### Significance

-   Study provides possible rationale for anosmia observed in several
    CoVID-19 patients.

-   Raises possibility that nasal respiratory goblet, ciliated cells,
    and olfactory epithelia may serve as a viral reservoir after initial
    SARS-CoV-2 infection.

-   Human olfactory sensory neurons express several other molecules
    important to CoV (not CoV-19) entry such as *FURIN, ST6GAL1,
    ST3GAL4*; this suggests wider mechanism of neuronal infectivity in
    other coronaviruses.
