#### Keywords

- Immunoassay
- serum IgM and IgG
- specific antibodies

#### Main Finding

This study showed that both anti-2019-nCov IgM and IgG were detected by
automated chemiluminescent immunoassay in the patients who had been
already confirmed as positive by nucleic acid detection, while single
positivity of IgM or IgG were detected in a very few cases in the other
population including 225 non-COVID-19 cases. In addition to the increase
of anti-2019-nCov IgM 7-12 days after morbidity, the increase of IgG was
detected in three patients with COVID-19 within a very short of time
(0-1 day).

#### Limitations

The limitation of this study is only
3 confirmed COVID-19 cases were included, so that the relationship
between anti-2019-nCov antibodies and disease progression might not be
clearly defined. Another limitation is that they did not show the course
of 2019-nCov specific antibodies in the cases with positive for COVID-19
but without clinical symptoms.

#### Significance

The detection of anti-2019-nCov antibodies can be an alternative method
to diagnose and treat COVID-19 more comprehensively by distinguish non
COVID-19 patients. It may be helpful to understand the course of
individual cases with COVID-19 to predict the prognosis if more cases
will be evaluated.
