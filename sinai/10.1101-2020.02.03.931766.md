#### Keywords

- ACE2
- Cholangiocytes
- COVID-associated Liver Damage

#### Summary

Using both publicly available scRNA-seq dataset of liver
samples from colorectal patients and scRNA-sequencing of four liver
samples from healthy volunteers, the authors show that ACE2 is
significantly enriched in the majority of cholangiocytes (59.7 %) but
not in hepatocytes (2.6%).

#### Main Findings

Using bioinformatics approaches of
RNASeq analysis, this study reveals that ACE2 dominates in
cholangiocytes and is present at very low levels in hepatocytes.

#### Limitations

The
study does not provide mechanistic insights into how SARS-CoV-2 can
infect and replicate in cholangiocytes and the types of intrinsic
anti-viral responses induced by cholangiocytes when infected. In
addition, because the study relies on the assumption that SARS-CoV-2
infects cells only through ACE2, it cannot discount the possibility that
the virus can infect hepatocytes through mechanisms other than
ACE2-mediated entry. Furthermore, because the scRNA-seq analysis were
performed on healthy liver samples, one cannot draw any definitive
conclusions about gene expression states (including ACE2 expression in
liver cell types) in system-wide inflammatory contexts.

#### Significance

This article with other studies on liver
damage in COVID patients suggests that liver damage observed in COVID
patients is more due to inflammatory cytokines than direct infection of
the liver. Even if cholangiocytes are infectable by SARS-CoV-2 (which
was demonstrated by human liver ductal organoid study
([@doi:10.1101/2020.03.16.990317]),
published clinical data show no significant increase in bile duct injury
related indexes (i.e. alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl
transpeptidase and total bilirubin). In sum, it underscores the
importance of future studies characterizing cellular responses of
extra-pulmonary organs in the context of COVID or at least in viral lung
infections..
